# Portfolio Management

## Backtesting

- fit model on admissible stocks (from ADF test and Hurst Exponent)

- build/re-create Patria cost schema

- optimize weights of stocks in portfolio

- monitor performance

- re-balance every month, i.e. in period from 1.1.2018 - 31.12.2020

- compare to simple benchmark model (get last month performance based on which the optimization is performed)
